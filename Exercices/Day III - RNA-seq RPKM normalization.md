## RNA-seq RPKM - exercises

Download the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 genome annotation in BED format found in the dataset folder.

1. In one step, read the file in R and give the dataframe (or tibble) the appropriate column names (chr, start, end, gene_id, score, strand).
2. Check the number of gene annotations and verify that there are no duplicated genes.
3. Create a new column named "size" that computed the length of genes.
4. Check how many genes from our RPM normalized matrix are found in the BED annotation.
